<b> Using the Aylien Text Analysis API with R

Aylien provides some useful API's for text analysis (sentiment, entity, concepts etc). This code has been developed for the R Community to explore the text API from Aylien further with R for some exciting analytics.

Visit http://aylien.com/text-api-doc for more details.


Disclaimer: I have developed this as an independent developer and am no way associated with Aylien. The code has been developed using the API reference available on Aylien.com.
